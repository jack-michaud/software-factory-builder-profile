# softwarefactorybuilder profile

This is a local-installable role distribution root for current Hermes. It is generated/maintained from the Software Factory profiles monorepo prototype.

Install locally for testing:

```bash
hermes profile install /path/to/software-factory-profiles/profiles/builder --name softwarefactorybuilder-monorepo-test --yes
```

Role boundary: Performs approved local implementation and, in separate explicitly scoped tasks, owns sprite mutations with checkpoint discipline.

## Generated public repository shape

This root is current-Hermes-compatible: `distribution.yaml` is at repository root.

Install after publication:

```bash
hermes profile install https://github.com/jack-michaud/software-factory-builder-profile.git --name softwarefactorybuilder
```

Update after publication:

```bash
hermes profile update softwarefactorybuilder --yes
```

Public/private boundary: credentials, runtime state, logs, memories, sessions, Kanban DB/workspaces, sprite credentials, SSH keys, OAuth tokens, API keys, and private Obsidian notes are not included.
